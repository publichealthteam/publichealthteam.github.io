<b>Joe Brew</b></a>: I think that the “immunity passport” concept is worth exploring. It’s a potentially useful tool. The main technical arguments against it (imperfect tests, doubts about the degree and duration of post-infection immunity, difficult to operationalize) seem surmountable. And the main ethical arguments against it (potential discrimination) seem relatively minor: I don’t see it as “discriminatory” to allow non-infectious people to behave differently than infectious people. In fact, we already do this (quarantines, lockdowns, etc.). In other words, differential policies based on epidemiological risk are the norm, not the exception (and should be!). The immunity passport would simply help us to apply differential policies in a more precise way. And the more precise we can be in terms of risk of being infected or infecting others, the better. We are willing to apply differential rules based on age, where you live, and travel history, because these factors correlate (imperfectly) with risk of infection. So, why should we willfully ignore the presence of antibodies?</p>

<b>Carlos Chaccour</b></a>: I think the main concern is certainty of knowledge relative to immunity. There is robust evidence that justify a differential protective approach for the most vulnerable i.e. protect the elderly and those with risk factors for severe disease. There is however, limited evolving knowledge on how protective post-infectious immunity is in terms of duration and magnitude, both against disease but also against the virus itself (i.e. we know that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/19/science.abc4776" target="_blank"> SARS-CoV-2 infection protects against rechallenge in rhesus macaques</a>). Note the exact virus at the same dose was used for the re-challenge, in other words we do not know whether these macaques are protected against a <a href="https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1244750382338719745?s=20" target="_blank"> challenge with a higher viral load or against a challenge with SARS-CoV-2 with a mutated spike protein</a>. Another key knowledge gap is whether convalescent individuals could have transient and asymptomatic viral carriage in the respiratory tract making them infectious. I see potential value in differential protective measures for those at higher risk (an equal approach would be unfair here) but these knowledge gaps pose some serious risks. A good question is, how much risk are we willing to take?</p></div>

<b>Joe</b></a>: So there are really two questions: First, the technical and scientific question of whether infection confers immunity, and the extent to which antibody tests are accurate enough to be useful. And second, the ethical question of whether we should operationalize post-infection immunity. You say that the first question  is the “main concern”, but I’m not so sure: to many, the ethical questions are more important (i.e. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01451-0" target="_blank"> this letter in Nature</a>). Regardless of what the “main concern” is, the second question (on ethics) is only relevant if the answer to the first question (does infection confer immunity) is “yes”. So, if you agree, let’s start with the technical and scientific question of the degree and duration of immunity (ie, whether immunity is operationalizable) before going into the ethical implications. We have evidence (albeit limited) that previous infection reduces one’s future susceptibility (and by extension, infectiousness), correct? You know more than me about this - what do we know, and what don’t we know?

<b>Carlos</b></a>: I agree that breaking this into two separate questions would make this more “digestible” but it might be an artificial separation; after all, technical certainty on efficacy (or at least an equipose in case of a clinical trial) should support actions for those actions to be ethical. Otherwise implementation becomes pseudo-experimental, which might be acceptable in some cases but should be recognized as that.

<p>Some things we know for sure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Antibodies against <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851497/pdf/07-0576_finalD.pdf">SARS-1 last around three years</a></li>
  <li>COVID-19 patients apparently <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/06/15/science.abc5902">generate potent neutralizing antibodies</a> against the virus</li>
  <li>SARS-CoV-2 mutates just like any other virus</li>
</ul>

<p>And some we don’t know for sure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How long protective immunity lasts</li>
  <li>How fast a new will strain develop</li>
  <li>If neutralizing antibodies against one strain will confer protection against another</li>
  <li>If seropositive individuals are capable of having temporary asymptomatic flares (i.e. to carry the virus temporarily)</li>
  <li>If asymptomatic infections generate strong protective immunity</li>
</ul>
