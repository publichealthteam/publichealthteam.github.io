<p><b>Summary: </b>Ivermectin may or may not be an effective therapy for Covid-19. <b>We don’t know.</b> And we probably won’t know with any degree of confidence until the results of some randomized, controlled trials come in. In the meantime, the data can be twisted to conform with one’s prior beliefs. This is an article about confirmation bias, using the case of ivermectin.</p>

<h3>What’s going on with ivermectin in Latin America?</h3>

<p>Although the very limited evidence supports the use of ivermectin against COVID-19, this antiparasitic has been included in the national therapeutic guidelines for COVID-19 in Peru and Bolivia and in sub-national guidelines in Brazil. There is also broadspread interest in its use in Chile. This surge in demand has caused some serious issues like mass administration of veterinary formulations to thousands of vulnerable populations and the selling of poor-quality/counterfeit formulations. Mass use of ivermectin is not exempt from risks, including a false sense of security that may hamper social distancing or even more complex immunological changes that might affect the way our body responds to viruses. </p>

<h3>So, is ivermectin in Latin America saving lives?</h3>

<p></p>

<h3>Wow, it looks like ivermectin is really great! We should be administering ivermectin everywhere, right?</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>What is ecological fallacy?</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>But “ecological” data is better than no data, right?</h3>

<p></p>

<h3>Okay, show me some data that makes ivermectin look bad.</h3>

<p></p>

<h3>But that’s just 2 countries. What about 15 countries from the original chart?</h3>

<p></p>

<h3>Wow. It looked like ivermectin decreases mortality. Now it looks like ivermectin increases mortality. I’m confused.</h3>
