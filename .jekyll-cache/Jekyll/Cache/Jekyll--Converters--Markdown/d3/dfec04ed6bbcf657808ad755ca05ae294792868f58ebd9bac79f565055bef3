<b>Joe Brew</b>: I think that the “immunity passport” concept is worth exploring. It’s a potentially useful tool. The main technical arguments against it (imperfect tests, doubts about the degree and duration of post-infection immunity, difficult to operationalize) seem surmountable. And the main ethical arguments against it (potential discrimination) seem relatively minor: I don’t see it as “discriminatory” to allow non-infectious people to behave differently than infectious people. In fact, we already do this (quarantines, lockdowns, etc.). In other words, differential policies based on epidemiological risk are the norm, not the exception (and should be!). The immunity passport would simply help us to apply differential policies in a more precise way. And the more precise we can be in terms of risk of being infected or infecting others, the better. We are willing to apply differential rules based on age, where you live, and travel history, because these factors correlate (imperfectly) with risk of infection. So, why should we willfully ignore the presence of antibodies?</p>

<b>Carlos Chaccour</b>: I think the main concern is certainty of knowledge relative to immunity. There is robust evidence that justify a differential protective approach for the most vulnerable i.e. protect the elderly and those with risk factors for severe disease. There is however, limited evolving knowledge on how protective post-infectious immunity is in terms of duration and magnitude, both against disease but also against the virus itself (i.e. we know that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/19/science.abc4776" target="_blank"> SARS-CoV-2 infection protects against rechallenge in rhesus macaques</a>). Note the exact virus at the same dose was used for the re-challenge, in other words we do not know whether these macaques are protected against a <a href="https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1244750382338719745?s=20" target="_blank"> challenge with a higher viral load or against a challenge with SARS-CoV-2 with a mutated spike protein</a>. Another key knowledge gap is whether convalescent individuals could have transient and asymptomatic viral carriage in the respiratory tract making them infectious. I see potential value in differential protective measures for those at higher risk (an equal approach would be unfair here) but these knowledge gaps pose some serious risks. A good question is, how much risk are we willing to take?</p></div>
