<b>Joe Brew</b>: I think that the “immunity passport” concept is worth exploring. It’s a potentially useful tool. The main technical arguments against it (imperfect tests, doubts about the degree and duration of post-infection immunity, difficult to operationalize) seem surmountable. And the main ethical arguments against it (potential discrimination) seem relatively minor: I don’t see it as “discriminatory” to allow non-infectious people to behave differently than infectious people. In fact, we already do this (quarantines, lockdowns, etc.). In other words, differential policies based on epidemiological risk are the norm, not the exception (and should be!). The immunity passport would simply help us to apply differential policies in a more precise way. And the more precise we can be in terms of risk of being infected or infecting others, the better. We are willing to apply differential rules based on age, where you live, and travel history, because these factors correlate (imperfectly) with risk of infection. So, why should we willfully ignore the presence of antibodies?</p>
